Task Manager — Arrays & Objects using Vanilla Javascript

A lightweight task board for learning arrays, objects, prompts/alerts, filtering, and console logging.

Users can add up to three tasks to an existing list; each task gets a unique incremental ID; and the console can show all tasks and completed tasks only.

✨ Features (based on brief)

Tasks stored as objects inside an array.

Add up to three new tasks via browser prompts.

Each new task gets a unique incremental id (based on the last task in the array).

Collect title, description, status from the user.

Filter to display only tasks with status === "done".

Clear, labeled console output of:

All tasks (entire array)

Completed tasks (filtered array)

Limit message when full:

“There are enough tasks on your board, please check them in the console.”
